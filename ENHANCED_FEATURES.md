# Bitcoin Satoshi Tracer - Enhanced Features Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced features implemented to address circular transaction detection and improve user experience for Bitcoin transaction tracing.

## 🔄 Circular Transaction Detection System

### What Are Circular Transactions?

Circular transactions occur when Bitcoin flows through a series of addresses and eventually returns to a previously visited address or set of addresses. These patterns can indicate:

- **Money Laundering**: Attempts to obscure the origin of funds
- **Mixing Services**: Services designed to enhance privacy by mixing coins
- **Complex Trading**: Automated trading systems that create loops
- **Change Address Reuse**: Poor wallet management leading to circular flows

### Detection Algorithms

Our system employs multiple sophisticated algorithms:

#### 1. Address-Based Cycle Detection
- **Purpose**: Identifies when the same address appears multiple times in a transaction chain
- **Method**: Tracks address reappearance within user-specified depth limits
- **Strength**: Catches simple circular patterns quickly

#### 2. Transaction Path Analysis
- **Purpose**: Uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find closed loops in transaction graphs
- **Method**: Explores transaction paths and detects when paths return to previously visited nodes
- **Strength**: Identifies complex multi-step circular patterns

#### 3. Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
- **Purpose**: Advanced graph analysis to find groups of transactions that are mutually reachable
- **Method**: Modified Tarjan's algorithm for transaction graph analysis
- **Strength**: Detects sophisticated circular networks and mixing patterns

### Risk Scoring System

Each detected circular pattern is assigned a risk score (0-1) based on multiple factors:

#### Scoring Factors

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Cycle Length** | 15% | Shorter cycles are more suspicious |
| **Complexity** | 20% | Higher address-to-transaction ratios indicate mixing |
| **Value Concentration** | 15% | Similar amounts suggest structured activity |
| **Timing Patterns** | 10% | Regular intervals indicate automation |
| **Address Diversity** | 15% | Mix of address types suggests sophistication |
| **Known Services** | 10% | Involvement of known mixing services |
| **Fresh Addresses** | 10% | High single-use address ratio |
| **Equal Splits** | 5% | Identical amounts suggest mixing |

#### Risk Categories

- 🔴 **High Risk (70-100%)**: Likely illicit activity or professional mixing
- 🟡 **Medium Risk (40-69%)**: Suspicious patterns requiring investigation
- 🟢 **Low Risk (0-39%)**: Legitimate circular flows (e.g., change addresses)
